'''

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.


Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sorting takes O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals
- Merging loop runs O(n) in a single pass
- Total Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Output list can hold up to O(n) intervals (in case of no merging)
- No extra data structures used beyond output
- Total Space Complexity: O(n)
