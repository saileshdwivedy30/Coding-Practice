Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.


Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sorting the array: O(n log n)
- Outer loop runs O(n) times
- Inner loop (two-pointer search) runs in total O(n) for each outer loop iteration
    => Total = O(n^2) for nested operations
- Skipping duplicates is part of pointer movement, still bounded by O(n)
- Overall Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Auxiliary space used by the algorithm (pointers, variables): O(1)
- Output list 'result' stores up to O(k) triplets
    - In the worst case, k = O(n^2) (if all triplets are valid and unique)
- Overall Space Complexity:
    - Auxiliary: O(1)
    - Output: O(n^2) worst-case
